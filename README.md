# Application-Approval-System
A full stack project on Application Approval made for ONGC. 
This project, "Web solution for creating and managing the user account using PHP," 
embodies the digital transformation of user account creation within Oil and Natural Gas

web application, the project simplifies the process. Users can submit account creation 
requests online, while automated approval streamlines the process. This innovation not only 
improves efficiency but also symbolizes ONGC's embrace of digital advancement, 
positioning it as a pioneer in user account management.
